#' @description PROSPER simulates the development of annual plant populations with regard to population dynamics and genetics, especially herbicide resistance. It combines genetics on the individual level with a stochastic development on the population level. The genetic part is modeled after Renton et al. (2011), the stochastic part follows Daedlow (2015). All parameters delivered with PROSPER are based on an area of 1 squaremeter.
